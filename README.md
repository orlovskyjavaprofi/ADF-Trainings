# ADF-Trainings
Here is the place for my OracleADF-Trainings
In Order to get in working you need Oracle HR Database, which freely available on oracle site or github, just look it up, for copyright reasons , 
i dont bother to make a copy of this database.
to run the tests and open the project you need latest Jdeveloper version, which in my case was 12.2.1
Second and the last thing, to make it work in your case you need to configure your DB connection, i use different name in my sys of my db, 
so you was WARNED, in order to run all of this stuff you need to configure your DB CONNECTION FIRST!
